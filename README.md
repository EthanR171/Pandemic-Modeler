- Allows user to pause simulation

## 📍The Process

This main goal of this group project was to re-familarize ourselves with Java and the GUI components associated. We refactored some pre-existing code which animates shapes in a GUI menu and applied
some logic which enables them to interact in new ways. One of the new features added was making each circle represent a person, which would contain data about their current health
status. When two circles collide, their new health statuses are compared and then updated accordingly. The math that determines the outcome was already provided, and thus may not be 
entirely accurate and should not be relied upon to make real life decisions.
